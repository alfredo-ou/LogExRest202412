PROJECT

   Ideas (Interactive Domain-specific Exercise Assistants) is a joint research
   project between the Open University of the Netherlands and Utrecht
   University. The project's goal is to use software and compiler technology to
   build state-of-the-art components of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and
   learning environments. The 'ideas' software package provides a generic
   framework for constructing the expert knowledge module (also known as a
   domain reasoner) for an ITS or learning environment. The 'ideas-math-types'
   software package provides helper datatypes for implementing domain reasoners
   for mathematics and logic. More information about the project can be found 
   on the project's homepage:
